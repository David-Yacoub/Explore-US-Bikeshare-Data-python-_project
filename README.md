# This is my first ever code with python

I used bikeshare2.py given by Udacity to fill the spaces at it and this is very helpful to me as a start to type code.
I used fwd 1st project pdf fiel as a main guide for the steps but I didn't copied the code from it.
I copied some of practice problem that I solved before to my code
many time i asked google about functions and these is some functions get by google help:
	df['day_of_week'] = df['Start Time'].dt.day_name()[stackoverflow]
	df['Start End Station'] = df[['Start Station', 'End Station']].agg('  to  '.join, axis=1)[stackoverflow]
	and many many small help from google
Calculating The Most Popular Stations and Trip take about 18 sec because I generate a new column it is need another functin take less time.
also after i finished the project I realizet that i didn't asked wich filter to use month or day or both and I am afraid to try and break the code and miss the date to submit, the user can select all to choose no filter
